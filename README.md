# Formula1 Data analysis

Project Overview
This project showcases a complete data pipeline, starting from the extraction of a Formula 1 dataset from an API using Python, transferring it to a SQL Server, and then performing extensive data cleaning and transformation. The ultimate goal is to prepare the dataset for detailed analysis and visualization.
